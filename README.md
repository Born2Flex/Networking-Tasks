# Networking Practice Tasks

## Task 1. JSON mapping

Create your own mapper (accepts Object, returns a string, must pass validation on a JSON string).
Do it recursively with nested objects. (User, some fields ints, strings, Address)

## Task 2. HTTP/HTTPS on Sockets

Given JSON as a string, you need to send a correct HTTP and HTTPS POST request using sockets to some endpoint
(a simple application with one endpoint), the application should read this object from JSON and give a response, 
the socket should receive a 200 response.
